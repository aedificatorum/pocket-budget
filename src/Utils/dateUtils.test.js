// TODO: Change the API to no longer support today only, but to support passing in a 'local' date
// So today would become implemented by calling into getMidnightTicks(new Date()) - leaving all the logic to test into the getMidnightTicks
// This could also simplify all the other functions to put all the local -> UTC logic into the getMidnightTicks functions
// e.g. getStartOfMonthTicks -> takes local date, finds start of the month (local), then returns getMidnightTicks(newDate)
